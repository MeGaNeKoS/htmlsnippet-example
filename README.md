# Project Name

## Introduction

This project is an example usage of [htmlsnippets](https://github.com/MeGaNeKoS/htmlsnippet)

## Prerequisites

List the prerequisites needed to run your project. This typically includes:

- Python (specify version, e.g., Python 3.8 or newer)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects. This keeps dependencies required by different projects separate. To set up a virtual environment, run:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

Install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Database Migrations

Django uses migrations to propagate changes you make to your models into the database schema. To apply migrations, run:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Creating a Superuser

To create an admin account for accessing the Django admin site, run:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create a superuser account.

## Running the Development Server

To start the Django development server, run:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the development server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ by default. You can access the Django admin site at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin.

## Additional Commands

### Checking for Project Issues

To check for any project configuration or compatibility issues, run:

```bash
python manage.py check
```

### Accessing the Django Shell
